Absolutely! Here's a neat and informative `README.md` for your **LinqInternals** project:

# LinqInternals

A simple C# practice project to understand and explore how LINQ works under the hood by implementing custom LINQ-like extension methods.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how you can extend the `IEnumerable<T>` interface by implementing your own version of LINQ's `Where()` method, called `NewWhere()`. It mimics the behavior of LINQ by using extension methods and delegates.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- C# (.NET 6 or later)
- Console Application
- .NET CLI

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/linqinternals.git
cd linqinternals
```

### 2. Run the project

```bash
dotnet run
```

Make sure you're inside the folder where the `.csproj` file exists.

│
├── Program.cs                 // Entry point: uses both built-in and custom LINQ
├── IEunumerableExtension.cs  // Custom extension method: NewWhere()
└── README.md                  // You're reading it 🙂
```

## 🧪 Example Usage

### Using Built-in LINQ:

```csharp
var evenItems = items.Where(x => x % 2 == 0);
```

### Using Custom LINQ:

```csharp
var evenItems = items.NewWhere(x => x % 2 == 0);
```

Both return only even numbers from the collection.
